###Git Basics

It was very informative course for me! 
At first I finished Udacity course. There was a lot of interesting and new information about Git.
I learned many new concepts:

* Creating a Git repositirium
* Adding commits
* Tagging
* Branching
* Merging
* Undoing changes

And after that I decided to practice with [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
It was very helpful to understand:

* How branches works
* How to work with remote repos
* How to work in team with Git
* Git fetch command
* Git pull and push commands
