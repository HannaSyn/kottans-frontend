## <a name="git_basics">Git Basics</a>

It was very informative course for me! 
At first I finished Udacity course. There was a lot of interesting and new information about Git.
I learned many new concepts, how to:

* Create a Git repositirium
* Add commits
* Tagging
* Branching
* Merging
* Undoing changes

Then I had practice with [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org).
I learned how to branching, git pull and push commands.

## <a name="linux_cli">Linux CLI, and HTTP</a>

During this part I repeated basics terminal commands with Linux Survival.
Some of them, (ex. grep) were new for me, I learned them and practice.

Articles about HTTP are very informative and useful.
I filled the gasps in knowledge about authentication, found out the difference between Basic Authentication and Digest Authentication - it was new information for me.
Also I expended my understanding HTTP caching: processing and controll headers.

## <a name="git_collab">Git Collaboration</a>

[Udacity couse](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456) about GitHub was not completely new for me, I've already known mostly things.
I repeated and become more confident in knowledge about forks.
To get commits from a source repository into forked repository on GitHub I need to:

* Get the cloneable URL of the source repository
* Create a new remote with the git remote add command
* Use the shortname upstream to point to the source repository
* Provide the URL of the source repository
* Fetch the new upstream remote
* Merge the upstream's branch into a local branch
* Push the newly updated local branch to your origin repo

I was surprised how many different and useful commands that I can do with git rebase:

- use `p` or `pick` – to keep the commit as is
- use `r` or `reword` – to keep the commit's content but alter the commit message
- use `e` or `edit` – to keep the commit's content but stop before committing so that you can:
  * add new content or files
  * remove content or files
  * alter the content that was going to be committed
- use `s` or `squash` – to combine this commit's changes into the previous commit (the commit above it in the list)
- use `f` or `fixup` – to combine this commit's change into the previous one but drop the commit message
- use `x` or `exec` – to run a shell command
- use `d` or `drop` – to delete the commit.

I think that most of them I intend to use in future.

And after that I had practice with [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
It was very helpful to understand:

* How branches works
* How to work with remote repos
* How to work in team with Git
* Git fetch command

## <a name="intro_html_css">Intro to HTML & CSS</a>

There was nothing new for me in [Intro to HTML and CSS Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001).
I already knew all the concepts and rules.

![html&css_intro-screenshot](task_html_css_intro/html_css_intro-screenshot_01.png)

And [Basics of HTML5 course on CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) also wasn't new for me. I repeated semantic to write HTML cleaner.

![html&css_intro-screenshot](task_html_css_intro/html_css_intro-screenshot_03.png)


[Basics of CSS3 course on CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) was the most interesting for me amoung this 3 courses.
I became more confident in `Grid Layout`, especially I interested in lesson [Advanced CSS GRID](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-grid-ii/).

Now I have learned new properties to use when creating a layout using CSS Grid:

* `grid-template-areas` specifies grid named grid areas
* `grid-auto-rows` specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
* `grid-auto-columns` specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
* `grid-auto-flow` specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created

## <a name="responsive">Responsive Web Design</a> 

[Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893) was not really new for me, but I refresh my knowledge about mediaqueries and responsive tables.

![udacity_responsive-screenshot](task_responsive_web_design/udacity_responsive-screenshot.png)

I've already played this awesome game before, but with pleasure did it again! I always think about frogs, when use flexbox :frog: [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/).

![flexfrogs-screenshot](task_responsive_web_design/flexfrogs-screenshot.png)

## <a name="hooli_popup">HTML & CSS Practice</a> 

[Demo](https://hannasyn.github.io/popup_task/)

I've tryed really hard to create awesome popup :star_struck:
I think that I get it, because I love it :heart_eyes:

I've never done popups without JS before, so this expirience was so excited! 
I learned how to _create buttons with checkboxes_, and its beatuful, I confidently intend to use it in future!

## <a name="js_basics">JavaScript Basics</a> 

At first, during [Udacity JS basics course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803), I refreshed my knowledge about types, loops and conditionals in JS. 

![Udacity-screenshot](task_js_basics/udacity_task_js.png)

The second part was full of new methods and functions. 

* _Basic JS exercises_ - 111 tiny tasks - really useful to learn and practice in JS basics.
* _ES6 Challenges_ - I couldn't stop to solve it, and done all of them, it is very interesting.
* _Basic Data Structures_ - manipulate with most important types of JS - Objects and Arrays - really exciting, I finally find out the difference between `slice()` and `splice()` on practice.
* _Basic Algorithm Scripting_ - all the exercises were not so easy for me, but very interesting to solve.
* _Functional Programming_ - this part help me to understand what functional programming accually is:

  > Functional programming is about:
  >  * Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
  >  * Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
  >  * Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

* _Algorithm Scripting Challenges_ :scream: -  it was the most dificult part for me. I've devided tasks on subtasks, looked for the hints or advice on MDN and google, but there were 2 times I've got a hint - in exercise "Diff two arrays" and "Pig latin". I guess, that I've learned my mistakes and fell gaps in skills. I itend to use loops more confidenty and often.

[_More screenshots here_](task_js_basics/)

## <a name="dom">Document Object Model</a> 

At the first topic, [JavaScript and the DOM](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud117), I've learned, how to:
* Create content with JS
* Work with events
* Make event loops
* Use `setTimeout()` method

![screenshot01-js_dom](task_js_dom/udacity-js_dom.png)

Also finish tasks at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/)

![screenshot02-js_dom](task_js_dom/fcc-js_dom.png)

And done practical task: _Implement interactive side-menu site without page reloads._

[Demo](https://hannasyn.github.io/DOM-facts/)

It was interesting and full of new knowledge topic. I really appreciate for reviews.

## <a name="pre_oop">Building a Tiny JS World (pre-OOP)</a> 

I built a tiny JS world model.

[Demo](https://hannasyn.github.io/a-tiny-JS-world/)

## <a name="oop">Object-Oriented JavaScript</a> 

Udacity oop course was full of new information for me.
Now I know about _Scopes_ and _Closures_, I more confident and consciously use _this_.
Was interesting to listen and do quizes about _Classes_, _Subclasses_ and its _Patterns_.

![screenshot_js_oop](task_js_oop/udacity-oop.png)

Then I did practice - to create a arcade frogger-game.
Although was not easy, I was surprised, how great to build app with OOP. It was new expirience for me.

[Demo](https://hannasyn.github.io/frogger-game/)

Also I registered, joined Kottans clan, practiced tiny exercises at codewars and reached 7 kyu.

[My codewars profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/HannaSyn)


## <a name="post-oop">OOP Exercise</a> 

I improve app Tiny JS world. It was unteresting - to work with hirarchy of classes, to learn modern 
syntax and how to use it. 

[Demo](https://hannasyn.github.io/a-tiny-JS-world/)
